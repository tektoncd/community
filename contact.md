## Shared Drive

[our shared Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AFOvPxM9MpebUk9PVA).
Anyone who joins [the `tekton-dev` mailing list](#mailing-list) will be able to add and edit files in this drive,
and anyone who joins the [the `tekton-users` mailing list](#mailing-list) will have read access. This drive
contains docs and our [working groups](./working-groups.md) recordings.
