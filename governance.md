## Governance Facilitator Role (optional)

The governance facilitator role is a non-voting, non-technical advisory position
that helps ensure all governance committee meetings are inclusive, and key
milestones toward governance are met. The facilitator is a role, meaning it may
be occupied by a single individual, or a series of individuals over time. The
goal of this position is servant leadership for the project, community, and
stakeholders. The committee may choose to make this a permanent role at their
discretion. Deliverables may include creation of mailing lists, project tracking
boards, governance draft documents, and so forth.

## Maximum Representation

No single employer/company may be represented by more than 40% (i.e., 2 seats)
of the board at any one time. If the results of an election result in greater
than 40% representation, the lowest vote getters from any particular company
will be removed until representation on the board is less than one-third.

If percentages shift because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events,
sufficient members of the committee must resign until max one-third
representation is achieved. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to
resign, the entire company’s representation will be removed and new special
elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for example
evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all
non-involved Governance Board members will decide.

## Committee Responsibilities and Deliverables

The committee MUST:

- [Represent a cross-section of interests, not just one company](#maximum-representation)
- Balance technical, architectural, and governance expertise
- Hold staggered terms, sufficient to ensure an orderly transition of power via
  elections
- Provide designated alternates in cases where quorum is required but not
  attainable with the current set of members
- Communicate with the Continuous Delivery Foundation on a regular cadence

The committee is responsible for a series of specific artifacts and activities:

- The [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) and handling violations
- The [Project Communication Channels](contact.md)
- The [Contribution Process](process.md) and
  [Development Standards](standards.md)
- The [Tekton Mission and Vision](roadmap.md)
- Select [election officers](#election-officers) to run elections

It defines the processes around
[TEPs](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/tree/main/teps). Should the
community fail to reach consensus on whether to accept a proposed TEP or not,
the governance committee can help to break the impasse.

## Governance Meetings and Decision-Making Process

Governance decisions, votes and questions should take place on the
tekton-governance@googlegroups.com mailing list.

The governance committee decisions are taken by seeking consensus towards a
motion from all its members. If the consensus cannot be reached, the motion may
be altered or dropped.

## Elections

### Voter Eligibility

Anyone who has at least 15 [contributions](process.md#contributions) in the last
12 months. The
[dashboard on tekton.devstats.cd.foundation](https://tekton.devstats.cd.foundation/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All)
will show GitHub based contributions; contributions that are not GitHub based
must be called out explicitly by the voter to confirm eligibility.

### Candidate Eligibility

Candidates themselves must be contributors who are eligible to vote, and must be
nominated by contributors from at least two companies, which can include their
own, and they can self-nominate.

### Nominations Process

Nominations should be sent to `tekton-nominations@googlegroups.com`. The email
should contain:

- The nominee’s email address, github handle, company affiliation, and tektoncd
  project(s) they contribute to
- For each of two contributors nominating this individual:
  - The company they work for
  - Their github handles
  - The tektoncd project(s) they contribute to

Any nominee who accepts the nomination will be on the ballot.

### Election Process

Elections will be held using time-limited
[Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) ranking on
[CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) using the
[Schulze method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method). The top vote
getters will be elected to the open seats. This is the same process used by the
Kubernetes project.

Details about the schedule and logistics of the election will be announced in a
timely manner by the election officers to eligible candidates and voters via the
tekton-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list.

Example timeline:

1. Before or during nominations, send an email to all elgible voters to notify
   them that they are eligble (allowing people time to reach out if they believe
   they are eligble but are not on our list) (we have used
   [this script](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/tree/main/election) in
   the past)
1. 1 week for nominations (previously, starting on a Thursday until midnight PST
   the next Wednesday)
1. 1 week for the election itself (starting the following Thursday until
   midnight PST the next Wednesday)

### Election Officers

For every election, the governance board wll choose three election officers, by
the following criteria, so as to promote healthy rotation and diversity:

- election officers must be eligible to vote
- two election officers should have served before
- one election officer should have never served before
- each officer should come from a different company to maintain 40% maximal
  representation
- election officers should not be currently running in the election

The governing board can decide to make exceptions to the above requirements if
needed (for example, if two people cannot be found who have served before and
want to be officers).

### Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected governance board
member, the candidate with the next most votes from the previous election will
be offered the seat. This process will continue until the seat is filled.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will
be held as soon as possible. Eligible voters from the most recent election will
vote in the special election (ie: eligibility will not be redetermined at the
time of the special election). A board member elected in a special election will
serve out the remainder of the term for the person they are replacing,
regardless of the length of that remainder.

### Email templates

For handy reference in future elections, here are some starter templates to send
out to announce phases in the election.

To announce opening up nomintations:

```
Hello Tekton contributors!

Today we officially open up the nominations for the <TBD number of seats> 2 year seats on our governing board [0] !

This section of our bylaws describes the entire process: [1].

If you would like to be nominated, please send an email to tekton-nominations@googlegroups.com. The email should contain:

* Your email address, github handle, the company you represent, and tektoncd project(s) you contribute to
* An explanation of how you meet the "15 contributions" criteria, with links to related artifacts if required (e.g. design docs). (Note the easiest way to meet this criteria is to be present on this devstats dashboard [3], however this only shows folks with GitHub based contributions. Please include a description of your non-GitHub contributions if applicable.)
* For each of two contributors nominating you:
  * The company they work for
  * Their github handles
  * The tektoncd project(s) they contribute to

As described in our bylaws [3], the election process requires three election officers, who are responsible for the execution of the election.
Election officers must be eligible to vote and should come each from a different company.

We already have <TBD number of election officers> election officers for this election:

* <TBD names and affiliations>

If you would like to serve as election officer, please reach out to any member of the governing board before the beginning of the voting process.

This is the election timeline:

    < TBD fill in timeline, below is example from 2021 >
    Feb 24 at midnight PST the nominations will close
    Feb 25 we will start the voting process via http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/
    Mar 3 we close the election

Please feel free to reach out to anyone on the governing board and/or reply to this email with any questions!

To announce the beginning of the election:

```
Hello everyone,

The <TBD year> governing board election has begun!

Everyone who is eligible to vote who we know of should now have received an email with a link to vote. If you think you should get one and you didn't, please check all of the email addresses that might be associated with your GitHub account, and your spam folder, and if you still can't find the email, let me know and I can add you to the poll.

Otherwise happy voting! The poll will close at midnight PST on <TBD date>.

Note that we have constrained the board such that no single employer can have more than 40% of the total seats. [0]

## Governing board leave policy

Any member of the governing board is welcome to take leave from being a governing board member, for any reason (which
they are not required to disclose). The actions taken will depend on both of:

1. The length of the leave: whether this is greater or less than approximately (at the discretion of the other governing board members)
   1/4 of their total term (since terms are 2 years, this means the criteria is whether or not the leave is greater than 6 months).
2. Whether their seat will be up for election during the period of their leave

If the leave is less than or equal to 1/4 of the board member's total term, and their seat will not be up for
re-election during that time, the governing board member may select someone to be an acting governing board member for
the length of the leave. This person must:

* Meet [the maximum representation requirement](#maximum-representation)
* Meet [the candidate eligibility requirements](#candidate-eligibility)

If the length of the leave is greater than 1/4 of the total term, or their seat will be up for election during the
leave period, the governing board member will be required to step down from their seat and an election will be held.
