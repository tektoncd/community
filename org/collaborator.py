# This script helps synchronize contents from their respective sources of
# truth (usually GitHub repositories of each Tekton
# components, such as tektoncd/pipelines) to tektoncd/website.

# This script builds a table collaborator for the various repos in the
# Tekton CD org. The list of collaborators is used to create configuration
# for collaborator teams on GitHub side, which are then sync'ed to GitHub
# via the existing peribolos infrastructure.

# Collaborators are selected by searching for anyone in the Tekton org
# that has contributed at least 5 commits (ever) to the specific repo.
# This script is meant as a one-off to setup the initial teams. Further
# edits to the teams will be managed by PRs to the org/org.yaml config.
