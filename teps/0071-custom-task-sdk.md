## Summary

A Custom Task SDK will make the work of custom task author easier and will offer
standard way to implement custom task controllers. While adhering to current
separation of concern between a custom task controller's role and tektoncd owned
controller's role, it should make custom tasks easier to manage and reason by
tektoncd.

## Motivation

1. Currently, a custom task author has limited ways to know what is a standard way
    of developing the custom task. Their best bet is to explore one of the existing 
   implementation in `experimental/` repo.
2. However, an experimental custom task may not be up to date with the latest `tektoncd`
   code base version. There is no one goto place, where a Task author can find upto
   date example.
3. Presently, `tektoncd` does not manage the life cycle of a custom task at all.
   A SDK can open up newer possibilities in this regard.
4. SDK available as a project template, can perform some of common tasks,
   generate boiler-plate code and provide helper functions/scripts.

### Goals

1. Provide a Github template with a simple controller and CRD implementation,
   which a user can fork and develop his own custom task controller.
2. Provide helper functions/packages for common tasks and documentation
   with best practices.

### Non-Goals

- providing SDKs in languages other than Go
- providing a generic CRD controller lib

### Use Cases (optional)

<!--
Describe the concrete improvement specific groups of users will see if the
Motivations in this doc result in a fix or feature.

Consider both the user's role (are they a Task author? Catalog Task user?
Cluster Admin? etc...) and experience (what workflows or actions are enhanced
if this problem is solved?).
-->

## Requirements

<!--
Describe constraints on the solution that must be met. Examples might include
performance characteristics that must be met, specific edge cases that must
be handled, or user scenarios that will be affected and must be accomodated.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.  The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### Notes/Caveats (optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above.
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate. Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside the WGs or subproject.
-->

### User Experience (optional)

<!--
Consideration about the user experience. Depending on the area of change,
users may be task and pipeline editors, they may trigger task and pipeline
runs or they may be responsible for monitoring the execution of runs,
via CLI, dashboard or a monitoring system.

Consider including folks that also work on CLI and dashboard.
-->

### Performance (optional)

<!--
Consideration about performance.
What impact does this change have on the start-up time and execution time
of task and pipeline runs? What impact does it have on the resource footprint
of Tekton controllers as well as task and pipeline runs?

Consider which use cases are impacted by this change and what are their
performance requirements.
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

If it's helpful to include workflow diagrams or any other related images,
add them under "/teps/images/". It's upto the TEP author to choose the name
of the file, but general guidance is to include at least TEP number in the
file name, for example, "/teps/images/NNNN-workflow.jpg".
-->

## Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

## Design Evaluation
<!--
How does this proposal affect the reusability, simplicity, flexibility 
and conformance of Tekton, as described in [design principles](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/design-principles.md)
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this TEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out?  These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG.  Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, github details.  Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->

## Upgrade & Migration Strategy (optional)

<!--
Use this section to detail wether this feature needs an upgrade or
migration strategy. This is especially useful when we modify a
behavior or add a feature that may replace and deprecate a current one.
-->

## Implementation Pull request(s)

<!--
Once the TEP is ready to be marked as implemented, list down all the Github
Pull-request(s) merged.
Note: This section is exclusively for merged pull requests, for this TEP.
It will be a quick reference for those looking for implementation of this TEP.
-->

## References (optional)
