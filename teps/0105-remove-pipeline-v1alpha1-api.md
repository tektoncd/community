# TEP-0105: Remove Pipeline v1alpha1 API

<!--
**Note:** When your TEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary", and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the TEP with the
  appropriate Working Group.
- [ ] **Create a PR for this TEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG that are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the TEP clarified and merged quickly.  The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a TEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved.  Any TEP
marked as a `proposed` is a working document and subject to change.  You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing TEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused.  If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

If there are new details that belong in the TEP, edit the TEP.  Once a
feature has become "implemented", major changes should get new TEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/teps/NNNN-TEP-template/README.md).

<!--
A table of contents is helpful for quickly jumping to sections of a TEP and for
highlighting any additional information provided beyond the standard TEP

tags, and then generate with `hack/update-toc.sh`.

## Summary

This TEP proposes a clear schedule for the removal of Pipeline's deprecated
`v1alpha1` API. As we [move towards the stable V1 API](./0096-pipelines-v1-api.md),
removing the long-deprecated `v1alpha1` API will help clarify migration paths for
users and simplify implementation of the `v1` API.

## Background

According to the Kubernetes [API versioning guidelines](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-overview/#api-versioning) and [deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/),
which Tekton follows (with the exception of not allowing removal of deprecated
APIs for a full 9 months for Beta or a year for Stable, since we release more
frequently than Kubernetes does), we have been allowed to remove `v1alpha1`
from Pipelines since `v1beta1` was introduced. But for understandable reasons,
we chose not to do so initially.

It has now been over two years since `v1alpha1` was deprecated and `v1beta1`
was introduced in [the 0.11.0 release]((https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.11.0),
at the end of March, 2020. Removing `v1alpha1` at this point should not be
overly disruptive for existing users, and doing so will simplify the process of
adding the upcoming `v1` stable API. Therefore, we should determine a timeframe
for the removal and start communicating that timeframe to users and downstream
consumers of the Pipeline `v1alpha1` API in the near future.

## Motivation

The Pipeline `v1alpha1` API has been deprecated [since the introduction of the v1beta1 API on March 31, 2020](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.11.0),
but has not yet been removed. As we approach `v1`, it would be good to remove
`v1alpha1` beforehand. This will allow us to be sure that no `v1alpha1`-specific
behavior or structs remain in `v1beta1`, as well as ensuring that users have
upgraded to at least `v1beta1` before `v1` is introduced.


### Goals

- Establishing a timeline for the removal of the Pipeline `v1alpha1` API.
- Communication of the planned removal of the Pipeline `v1alpha1` API.
- Removal of Pipeline `v1alpha1` usage from all documentation, tutorials, and
  examples.
- Removal of the Pipeline `v1alpha1` API from the Pipelines project.
- Updating of other Tekton projects currently utilizing the Pipeline `v1alpha`
  API to use `v1beta1` instead, if necessary.

### Non-Goals

- Ensuring compatibility for third-party uses of the `v1alpha1` API.

### Use Cases

<!--
Describe the concrete improvement specific groups of users will see if the
Motivations in this doc result in a fix or feature.

Consider both the user's role (are they a Task author? Catalog Task user?
Cluster Admin? etc...) and experience (what workflows or actions are enhanced
if this problem is solved?).
-->

## Requirements

<!--
Describe constraints on the solution that must be met. Examples might include
performance characteristics that must be met, specific edge cases that must
be handled, or user scenarios that will be affected and must be accomodated.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.  The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### Notes/Caveats (optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above.
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate. Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside the WGs or subproject.
-->

### User Experience (optional)

<!--
Consideration about the user experience. Depending on the area of change,
users may be task and pipeline editors, they may trigger task and pipeline
runs or they may be responsible for monitoring the execution of runs,
via CLI, dashboard or a monitoring system.

Consider including folks that also work on CLI and dashboard.
-->

### Performance (optional)

<!--
Consideration about performance.
What impact does this change have on the start-up time and execution time
of task and pipeline runs? What impact does it have on the resource footprint
of Tekton controllers as well as task and pipeline runs?

Consider which use cases are impacted by this change and what are their
performance requirements.
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

If it's helpful to include workflow diagrams or any other related images,
add them under "/teps/images/". It's upto the TEP author to choose the name
of the file, but general guidance is to include at least TEP number in the
file name, for example, "/teps/images/NNNN-workflow.jpg".
-->

## Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

## Design Evaluation
<!--
How does this proposal affect the api conventions, reusability, simplicity, flexibility 
and conformance of Tekton, as described in [design principles](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/design-principles.md)
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this TEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out?  These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG.  Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, github details.  Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->

## Upgrade & Migration Strategy (optional)

<!--
Use this section to detail wether this feature needs an upgrade or
migration strategy. This is especially useful when we modify a
behavior or add a feature that may replace and deprecate a current one.
-->

## Implementation Pull request(s)

<!--
Once the TEP is ready to be marked as implemented, list down all the Github
Pull-request(s) merged.
Note: This section is exclusively for merged pull requests, for this TEP.
It will be a quick reference for those looking for implementation of this TEP.
-->

## References (optional)

<!--
Use this section to add links to GitHub issues, other TEPs, design docs in Tekton
shared drive, examples, etc. This is useful to refer back to any other related links
to get more details.
-->
