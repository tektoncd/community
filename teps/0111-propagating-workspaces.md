## Summary

This proposal builds on prior work to reduce the verbosity of passing Workspaces to improve usability of *Tekton Pipelines*.

## Motivation

The verbosity of writing specifications in *Tekton Pipelines* is a common pain point that creates difficulties in
getting-started scenarios. In addition, the verbosity leads to long specifications that are error-prone, harder to
maintain, and reach the etcd size limits for CRDs. Automatically propagating `Workspaces` will lead to better user 
experience.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: sensitive-recipe-storage
data:
  brownies: |
    My secret recipe!
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-password
type: Opaque
data:
  password: aHVudGVyMg==

          workspace: recipe-store
        - name: filedrop
          workspace: shared-data
      taskSpec:
        workspaces:
          - name: secret-password
          - name: secure-store

          script: |
            if [ "hunter2" = "$(cat $(workspaces.secret-password.path)/password)" ]; then
              cp $(workspaces.secure-store.path)/recipe.txt $(workspaces.filedrop.path)
              echo "success!!!"
            else
              echo "wrong password!"
              exit 1
            fi
    - name: print-the-recipe
      workspaces:
        - name: filedrop
          workspace: shared-data
      runAfter:
        - fetch-secure-data
      taskSpec:
        workspaces:
          - name: filedrop 
        steps:
        - name: print-secrets
          image: ubuntu
          script: cat $(workspaces.filedrop.path)/$(params.filename)
```

## Proposal

We propose interpolating `Workspaces` in embedded specifications during resolution. With this approach, we do not mutate the specifications before storage. The `Workspaces` that are required by each `Step` of the `PipelineTask` are determined by extracting the `Workspace` variables from their `Script` and `Args`. Only the `Workspaces` required by the `Steps` of the `PipelineTask` are propagated through to it. From the `PipelineTasks` (at `TaskRun` creation time) they are propagated down to the `TaskSpec` (before `Pod` creation).

### Embedded Specifications

The propagation of `Workspaces` will only work for embedded specifications.

### Referenced Resources

The propagation of `Workspaces` will not work for `referenced specifications` because the behavior would become opaque when users can't see the relationship between `Workspaces` declared in the referenced resources and the `Workspaces` supplied in runtime resources. Attempting to propagate `Workspaces` to referenced resources will cause failures.

```yaml
# PipelineRun attempting to propagate Workspaces to referenced Tasks
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: sensitive-recipe-storage

  brownies: |
    My secret recipe!

### Embedded Specifications with Referenced Resources

In the case of embedded specifications that have references, we will propagate the `Workspaces` up to the embedded specification level only. Users would need to explicitly declare `Workspaces` wherever they reference resources. See the example `PipelineRun` below for more details.

```yaml
# PipelineRun attempting to propagate Workspaces to referenced Tasks
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: fetch-secure-data
spec:
  workspaces: # If Referenced, Workspaces need to be explicitly declared
  - name: recipe-store
  - name: shared-data
  - name: password-vault
  steps:
  - name: fetch-and-write
    image: ubuntu
    script: |
      if [ "hunter2" = "$(cat $(workspaces.password-vault.path)/password)" ]; then
        cp $(workspaces.recipe-store.path)/recipe.txt $(workspaces.shared-data.path)
      else
        echo "wrong password!"
        exit 1
      fi

```

## Alternatives

### Propagate all workspaces to all Pipeline Tasks 

Propagating all `Workspaces` defined at `PipelineRun` down to all the `PipelineTasks` regardless of whether they are used by that `PipelineTask`. However, a workspace may have sensitive data that we don’t want to be accessible to all tasks. This approach is rejected because we only want data available where it is needed. We could remove the unwanted workspaces just before creating the task pod but this method will in turn also propagate workspaces for referenced parameters which we want to avoid because the behavior becomes opaque when users can't see the relationship between Workspaces declared in the referenced resources and the Workspaces supplied in runtime resources.
