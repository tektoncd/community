## Summary

The aim of this TEP is to promote `Custom Tasks`, which are used to extensibility in Tekton Pipelines, from alpha to 
beta.

## Motivation

[TEP-0002: Custom Tasks][tep-0002] introduced `Custom Tasks` which allow users to extend the functionality of Tekton 
Pipelines. Users implement controllers that watch for `Runs` that implement their types of `Custom Tasks`. 

`Runs` is in `v1alpha1`. `Runs` and `PipelineResources` are the only remaining types in `v1alpha1` - see [TEP-0105]
[tep-0105] for more details on `v1alpha1`.

Use of `Custom Tasks` in `Pipelines` is also gated behind feature flags: either `enable-custom-tasks` needs to be 
set to `"true"` or `enable-api-fields` needs to be set to `"alpha"`.

`Custom Tasks` have been available since [v0.19.0][v0.19.0] of Tekton Pipelines released in December 2020.
Many `Custom Tasks` have been created to extend Tekton Pipelines functionality, including but not limited to:
- [Task Loops][task-loops]: Runs a `Task` in a loop with varying `Parameter` values. 
- [Pipeline Loops][pipeline-loops]: Runs a `Pipeline` in a loop with varying `Parameter` values.
- [Common Expression Language][cel]: Provides Common Expression Language support in Tekton Pipelines.
- [Wait][wait]: Waits a given amount of time, specified by a `Parameter` named "duration", before succeeding.
- [Approvals][approvals]: Pauses the execution of `PipelineRuns` and waits for manual approvals.
- [Pipelines in Pipelines][pipelines-in-pipelines]: Defines and executes a `Pipeline` in a `Pipeline`. 
- [Task Group][task-group]: Groups `Tasks` together as a `Task`.
- [Pipeline in a Pod][pipeline-in-pod]: Runs `Pipeline` in a `Pod`.

As discussed in [TEP-0096][tep-0096], `Custom Tasks` are critical for extensibility in Tekton Pipelines, as such
promoting `Custom Tasks` to beta is a blocker for releasing v1 of Tekton Pipelines.

## Proposal

In this section, we scope the promotion of `Custom Tasks` to beta. The work in [required](#required) must be done,
while the work in [optional](#optional) may be done.

### Required

The work scoped here are blockers for promotion.

#### API Changes

##### v1alpha1 to v1beta1 + Run to CustomRun

Move `v1alpha1.Run` to `v1beta1.CustomRun`.

The migration from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1` provides an opportunity to rename `Runs` to `CustomRuns`. Reasons for the 
name change as discussed in [tektoncd/pipelines#5005][5005] and [API WG meeting][wg-notes] include.:
- `PipelineRuns` execute `Pipelines` and `TaskRuns` execute `Tasks`, so it is consistent for `CustomRuns` to execute
  `CustomTasks`.
- The current name `Runs` may suggest that it's an interface that `PipelineRuns` and `TaskRuns` implement.

##### References and Specifications

Clarify references and specifications.

Today, [embedded specs][runs-spec-docs] are in `Run.Spec.Spec`. We propose aligning the embedded specs with the rest of
the API such that it's `CustomRun.Spec.CustomSpec`.

  ```yaml
  # before
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: Run
  metadata:
    name: run-with-spec
  spec:
    spec:
      apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
      kind: Example
      spec:
        field1: value1
        field2: value2
  # after
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
  kind: CustomRun
  metadata:
    name: customrun-with-spec
  spec:
    customSpec:
      apiVersion: example.dev/v1beta1
      kind: Example
      spec:
        field1: value1
        field2: value2
  ```

Today, [references][runs-spec-docs] are in `Run.Spec.Ref`. We propose aligning the references with the rest of the
API such that it's `CustomRun.Spec.CustomRef`.

  ```yaml
  # before
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: Run
  metadata:
    name: run-with-reference
  spec:
    ref:
      apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
      kind: Example
      name: my-example
  ---
  # after
  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
  kind: CustomRun
  metadata:
    name: customrun-with-reference
  spec:
    customRef:
      apiVersion: example.dev/v1beta1
      kind: Example
      name: my-customtask
  ```

Note that the API for `TaskRuns` and `PipelineRuns` is:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: pipelinerun-with-ref
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: my-pipeline
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: taskrun-with-reference
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: my-task
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: pipelinerun-with-spec
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    params:
      - name: param1
    tasks:
      - name: my-task
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: taskrun-with-spec
spec:
  taskSpec:
    params:
      - name: param1
    steps:
      - name: my-step
```

Simplifying all the references to use `ref` and embedded specifications to use `spec` is out of scope for this TEP. That
work is tracked in [tektoncd/pipeline#5138][5138].

##### Remove Pod Template

Remove `podTemplate` field that assumes and implies that all `Custom Tasks` create `Pods`. 

Note that the goal of `Custom Tasks`, as defined in [TEP-0002][tep-0002], is to support non-Pod `Task` implementations.
If a specific `Custom Task` implementation creates `Pods`, that `Custom Task` can have a `Pod` template field in its
own specification.

##### Feature Gates

##### New Feature Flag `custom-task-version`

Support both `v1alpha1.Run` and `v1beta1.CustomRun` for **four** [long term support (LTS)][long-term-support] 
releases. So that custom task implementors and end users are able to fully test and migrate Custom Task from
`v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`. 

Create a new feature flag `custom-task-version` to allow end users to choose which version of custom task to be 
created out of a `PipelineTask`. We set the default feature flag value to `v1alpha1` in the first LTS release, and
switch to `v1beta1` in the following three LTS releases.

Say we start to support `v1beta1.CustomRun` in LTS release `X`, and set default value of `custom-task-version`
to `v1alpha1`. In the LTS release `X+1`, we switch the default value to `v1beta1`. In the LTS release `X+4`, we
remove the feature flag, and only support `v1beta1`.

##### Existing Feature Gates

Remove guarding of `Custom Tasks` behind `enable-custom-tasks` and `enable-api-fields` feature gates.

When [TEP-0096: Pipelines V1 API][tep-0096] is implemented to add V1 API, `Custom Tasks` will be gated behind feature
gate `enable-api-fields` being set to `"beta"` - this is out of scope for this TEP  (in scope for TEP-0096).

#### Cancellation

The `Custom Task` is responsible for implementing `cancellation` to support `PipelineRun` level `timeouts` and
`cancellation`. If the `Custom Task` implementor does not support cancellation via `.spec.status`, `Pipeline`
**can not** timeout within the specified interval/duration and **can not** be cancelled as expected upon request.

Pipeline Controller sets the `spec.Status` and `spec.StatusMessage` to signal `CustomRuns` about the `Cancellation`,
while `CustomRun` controller updates its `status.conditions` as following once noticed the change on `spec.Status`.

| Pipeline Signal                                                          | `CustomRun.Spec.Status` | `CustomRun.Spec.StatusMessage`                                              | `CustomRun.Status.Conditions`                                      | 
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Cancelling][cancel-pr]<br>[Gracefully Cancelling][gracefully-cancel-pr] | `RunCancelled`          | `CustomRun cancelled as the PipelineRun it belongs to has been cancelled. ` | `Type: Succeeded`<br>`Status:False`<br>`Reason:CustomRunCancelled` |
| `Pipeline` timeouts                                                      | `RunCancelled`          | `CustomRun cancelled as the PipelineRun it belongs to has timed out.`       | `Type: Succeeded`<br>`Status:False`<br>`Reason:CustomRunCancelled` |

#### Documentation

Expand the documentation for [`Custom Tasks`][custom-tasks-docs] and [`Runs`][runs-docs]. 

#### Testing

Improve the test coverage for `Custom Tasks` and `Runs`. 

Writing end-to-end tests for `Custom Tasks` and `Runs` has been difficult because we don't have `Custom Tasks` 
controllers in Tekton Pipelines. We propose adding a simple `Custom Task` controller in Tekton Pipelines that's used 
only for tests. This could be a version of the [`Wait Custom Task`][wait] or [`CEL Custom Task`][cel]. We'd import this
`Custom Task` into Tekton Pipelines to avoid a dependency on the Tekton Experimental. This `Custom Task` will not be
packaged with the Tekton Pipelines release - it's only intended for testing in Tekton Pipelines.

### Optional

The work scoped here are nice-to-have ahead of the promotion - they are not blockers.

#### Authoring Custom Tasks

Improve the user experience of authoring Custom Tasks and their controllers.

Implementing `Custom Tasks` and their controllers can be difficult for new users of the feature. We can improve the 
authoring experience through:
- providing SDK or boilerplate for getting started - this enhancement is proposed in [TEP-0071][tep-0071].
- providing a guide for authoring `Custom Tasks` and their controllers, including security recommendations such as
scoping permissions.

#### Sharing Custom Tasks

Make it easy to share and discover Custom Tasks.

Discovering `Custom Tasks` is difficult because some exist in the experimental repository in Tekton and others are
contributors' own repositories - this makes it hard to share and reuse `Custom Tasks`. The Tekton Hub is the platform
for users to discover and share Tekton resources. We propose that the Hub supports `Custom Tasks`. 

##### Custom Tasks in Tekton Hub

This is an overview of a potential solution for supporting Custom Tasks in the Hub and its CLI. Further details will be 
discussed in these issues - [tektoncd/community#667][667] and [tektoncd/cli#1623][1623] - and in its own TEP if needed. 

To support Custom Tasks in the Tekton Hub, we will add `customtasks.yaml` that will be used to list `Custom Tasks` to 
be surfaced in the Hub, in the same way that [config.yaml][config] is used for Catalogs with `Tasks` and `Pipelines`.

Each entry in `customtasks.yaml` will specify a `Custom Task` surfaced in the Hub, for example:

```yaml
custom-tasks:
  
  - name: approval
    org: automatiko-io
    type: community
    provider: github
    url: https://github.com/automatiko-io/automatiko-approval-task
    revision: main
    categories: 
      - deployment
      - automation
  
  - name: task-group
    org: openshift-pipelines
    type: community
    provider: github
    url: github.com/openshift-pipelines/tekton-task-group
    revision: main
    categories:
      - storage 
      
  - name: cel
    org: tektoncd
    type: official
    provider: github
    url: github.com/tektoncd/cel
    revision: main
    tags:
      - language 
```

We will require that the listed `Custom Tasks` must have `README.md` documenting its installation and functionality, 
which will be surfaced in the Hub. The [Hub CLI][hub-cli] will support `Custom Tasks` that are surfaced in the Hub:

```shell
$ tkn hub install custom task approval
$ tkn hub install custom-task cel
```

The Hub should fetch and surface the releases of the `Custom Tasks`, e.g `TaskGroup` has release [v0.1.1][tg-release]:

```shell
$ tkn hub install custom-task task-group --version v0.1.1
```

For further details, see [tektoncd/community#523][523], [tektoncd/community#667][667], and [tektoncd/cli#1623][1623].
