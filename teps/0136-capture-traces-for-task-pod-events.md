## Summary

This proposal extends instrumentation of tekton pipelines to include traces for pod events. Currently only reconciler related events are recorded as traces. The proposal is to capture container state changes (Started -> ContainerCreating -> Running -> Finished ) for each step of each task in the trace.

## Motivation

When we debug the performance of tekton pipelines, it is important to understand how much time is being spent on each step of the tasks. The total time of execution for a pipeline includes the time taken to initialize the pod, pull the images, run of init containers, sidecars etc. until completion. By tracing these phases, the end-users can easily visualize the steps in Jaeger UI.

### Goals

- Capture traces during phase change of a task pod
  - Creation of container
  - Running the container
  - Finish running the container
- Capture error and exit codes if the task was not successful due to failure in a step


### Non-Goals

- Tracing individual lines of each step
- Tracing sidecars

### Use Cases

As a pipeline user:
- I would like to understand the time taken by each step in a task so that I can optimize for performance
- I would like to visualize the task steps in Jaeger to get a better understanding of the flow

### Requirements

- Enable tracing and provide Jaeger endpoint URL to the operator

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### Notes and Caveats

<!--
(optional)

Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
- What are the caveats to the proposal?
- What are some important details that didn't come across above?
- What are the core concepts and how do they relate?
-->


## Design Details

When a `TaskRun` is created in the cluster, the status field of the taskrun is updated as per the example below,

```
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-02-14T08:43:51Z"
    message: 'pod status "Ready":"False"; message: "containers with unready status:
      [step-echo step-echo2]"'
    reason: Pending
    status: Unknown
    type: Succeeded
  podName: hello-task-run-pod
  startTime: "2023-02-14T08:43:41Z"
  steps:
  - container: step-echo
    name: echo
    waiting:
      reason: PodInitializing
  - container: step-echo2
    name: echo2
    waiting:
      reason: PodInitializing
  taskSpec:
    steps:
    ...
```

### Capturing step status update

The method `setTaskRunStatusBasedOnStepStatus` in `pkg/pod/status.go` updates the step status based on pod container statuses. 

Code block:

```
trs.Steps = append(trs.Steps, v1beta1.StepState{
  ContainerState: *s.State.DeepCopy(),
  Name:           trimStepPrefix(s.Name),
  ContainerName:  s.Name,
  ImageID:        s.ImageID,
})
```

While capturing the trace, we should only create the event during state transition. So the logic is,

* Take a copy of `trs.Steps`
* After calling the method `podconvert.MakeTaskRunStatus` from `taskRun.go` (which in-turn executes the above code),
   - compare the existing status with new status
   - raise trace event if there is a state transition

If we don't have the above logic in place, we will end up with duplicate trace events corresponding to the same step status.

### Capturing pod failure event

If a task is failed, the following block of code from `failTaskRun()` in `taskrun.go` updates the status for each step in `TaskRun` CR.


```
	// Update step states for TaskRun on TaskRun object since pod has been deleted for cancel or timeout
	for i, step := range tr.Status.Steps {
		// If running, include StartedAt for when step began running
		if step.Running != nil {
			step.Terminated = &corev1.ContainerStateTerminated{
				ExitCode:   1,
				StartedAt:  step.Running.StartedAt,
				FinishedAt: completionTime,
				Reason:     reason.String(),
			}
			step.Running = nil
			tr.Status.Steps[i] = step
		}

		if step.Waiting != nil {
			step.Terminated = &corev1.ContainerStateTerminated{
				ExitCode:   1,
				FinishedAt: completionTime,
				Reason:     reason.String(),
			}
			step.Waiting = nil
			tr.Status.Steps[i] = step
		}
	}
```

During this phase transition, we can capture the trace and raise an event.


## Design Evaluation
<!--
How does this proposal affect the api conventions, reusability, simplicity, flexibility
and conformance of Tekton, as described in [design principles](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/design-principles.md)
-->

### Reusability

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#reusability

- Are there existing features related to the proposed features? Were the existing features reused?
- Is the problem being solved an authoring-time or runtime-concern? Is the proposed feature at the appropriate level
authoring or runtime?
-->

### Simplicity

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#simplicity

- How does this proposal affect the user experience?
- Whatâ€™s the current user experience without the feature and how challenging is it?
- What will be the user experience with the feature? How would it have changed?
- Does this proposal contain the bare minimum change needed to solve for the use cases?
- Are there any implicit behaviors in the proposal? Would users expect these implicit behaviors or would they be
surprising? Are there security implications for these implicit behaviors?
-->

### Flexibility

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#flexibility

- Are there dependencies that need to be pulled in for this proposal to work? What support or maintenance would be
required for these dependencies?
- Are we coupling two or more Tekton projects in this proposal (e.g. coupling Pipelines to Chains)?
- Are we coupling Tekton and other projects (e.g. Knative, Sigstore) in this proposal?
- What is the impact of the coupling to operators e.g. maintenance & end-to-end testing?
- Are there opinionated choices being made in this proposal? If so, are they necessary and can users extend it with
their own choices?
-->

### Conformance

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#conformance

- Does this proposal require the user to understand how the Tekton API is implemented?
- Does this proposal introduce additional Kubernetes concepts into the API? If so, is this necessary?
- If the API is changing as a result of this proposal, what updates are needed to the
[API spec](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/api-spec.md)?
-->

### User Experience

<!--
(optional)

Consideration about the user experience. Depending on the area of change,
users may be Task and Pipeline editors, they may trigger TaskRuns and
PipelineRuns or they may be responsible for monitoring the execution of runs,
via CLI, dashboard or a monitoring system.

Consider including folks that also work on CLI and dashboard.
-->

### Performance

<!--
(optional)

Consider which use cases are impacted by this change and what are their
performance requirements.
- What impact does this change have on the start-up time and execution time
of TaskRuns and PipelineRuns?
- What impact does it have on the resource footprint of Tekton controllers
as well as TaskRuns and PipelineRuns?
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Tekton ecosystem. Consider including folks that also work outside the WGs
or subproject.
- How will security be reviewed and by whom?
- How will UX be reviewed and by whom?
-->

### Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this TEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->


## Implementation Plan

<!--
What are the implementation phases or milestones? Taking an incremental approach
makes it easier to review and merge the implementation pull request.
-->


### Test Plan

<!--
Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

### Infrastructure Needed

<!--
(optional)

Use this section if you need things from the project or working group.
Examples include a new subproject, repos requested, GitHub details.
Listing these here allows a working group to get the process for these
resources started right away.
-->

### Upgrade and Migration Strategy

<!--
(optional)

Use this section to detail whether this feature needs an upgrade or
migration strategy. This is especially useful when we modify a
behavior or add a feature that may replace and deprecate a current one.
-->

### Implementation Pull Requests

<!--
Once the TEP is ready to be marked as implemented, list down all the GitHub
merged pull requests.

Note: This section is exclusively for merged pull requests for this TEP.
It will be a quick reference for those looking for implementation of this TEP.
