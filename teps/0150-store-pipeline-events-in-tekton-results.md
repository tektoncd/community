## Summary
Tekton Results stores so far PipelineRuns, TaskRuns and Logs. 
This TEP proposes to store Pipeline Events as well to have all historical data from a PipelineRun in Tekton Results.


## Motivation
Sometimes a pipeline couldn't be executed successfully. In this case, the user would like to know what happened.
With some settings, the TaskRun Pods get evicted within minutes. In case of an error the user can't see the events anymore.
Sometimes there aren't even logs produced and in this case, it helps the user to have the event to have an idea what happened.
The Events should be stored in the same table as the TaskRunLogs. Alternatively they could also be stored in a separate table or serialized to a S3 Bucket.


### Goals
- Storing all the Events which relate to a PipelineRun in Tekton Results (Pod, TaskRun, PipelineRun). 
- Each event will be stored as a Record in the Tekton Results DB.
- The stored event can be stripped down to the relevant information like the cause of the event.
- Storing events are by default deactivated and can be activated by setting a property.
- In case of a cleanup job will be implemented, the events will be deleted as well.
- Watcher stores the Event
- Api provides Api to query the events


### Non-Goals

<!--
Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion and make progress.
- What is out of scope for this TEP?
-->

### Use Cases

It should be possible to query the history of Events of a PipelineRun or TaskRun.

### Requirements

Following fields need to be available in the Event Object stored in the DB:
- regarding.kind
- regarding.name
- regarding.additionalProperties['taskName']
- reason
- note
- metadata.creationTimestamp

Also it should be possible to query the Events of a PipelineRun or TaskRun to group them.


## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### Notes and Caveats

<!--
(optional)

Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
- What are the caveats to the proposal?
- What are some important details that didn't come across above?
- What are the core concepts and how do they relate?
-->


## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

If it's helpful to include workflow diagrams or any other related images,
add them under "/teps/images/". It's upto the TEP author to choose the name
of the file, but general guidance is to include at least TEP number in the
file name, for example, "/teps/images/NNNN-workflow.jpg".
-->


## Design Evaluation
<!--
How does this proposal affect the api conventions, reusability, simplicity, flexibility
and conformance of Tekton, as described in [design principles](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/design-principles.md)
-->

### Reusability

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#reusability

- Are there existing features related to the proposed features? Were the existing features reused?
- Is the problem being solved an authoring-time or runtime-concern? Is the proposed feature at the appropriate level
authoring or runtime?
-->

### Simplicity

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#simplicity

- How does this proposal affect the user experience?
- What’s the current user experience without the feature and how challenging is it?
- What will be the user experience with the feature? How would it have changed?
- Does this proposal contain the bare minimum change needed to solve for the use cases?
- Are there any implicit behaviors in the proposal? Would users expect these implicit behaviors or would they be
surprising? Are there security implications for these implicit behaviors?
-->

### Flexibility

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#flexibility

- Are there dependencies that need to be pulled in for this proposal to work? What support or maintenance would be
required for these dependencies?
- Are we coupling two or more Tekton projects in this proposal (e.g. coupling Pipelines to Chains)?
- Are we coupling Tekton and other projects (e.g. Knative, Sigstore) in this proposal?
- What is the impact of the coupling to operators e.g. maintenance & end-to-end testing?
- Are there opinionated choices being made in this proposal? If so, are they necessary and can users extend it with
their own choices?
-->

### Conformance

<!--
https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md#conformance

- Does this proposal require the user to understand how the Tekton API is implemented?
- Does this proposal introduce additional Kubernetes concepts into the API? If so, is this necessary?
- If the API is changing as a result of this proposal, what updates are needed to the
[API spec](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/api-spec.md)?
-->

### User Experience

<!--
(optional)

Consideration about the user experience. Depending on the area of change,
users may be Task and Pipeline editors, they may trigger TaskRuns and
PipelineRuns or they may be responsible for monitoring the execution of runs,
via CLI, dashboard or a monitoring system.

Consider including folks that also work on CLI and dashboard.
-->

### Performance

<!--
(optional)

Consider which use cases are impacted by this change and what are their
performance requirements.
- What impact does this change have on the start-up time and execution time
of TaskRuns and PipelineRuns?
- What impact does it have on the resource footprint of Tekton controllers
as well as TaskRuns and PipelineRuns?
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Tekton ecosystem. Consider including folks that also work outside the WGs
or subproject.
- How will security be reviewed and by whom?
- How will UX be reviewed and by whom?
-->

### Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this TEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->


## Implementation Plan

<!--
What are the implementation phases or milestones? Taking an incremental approach
makes it easier to review and merge the implementation pull request.
-->


### Test Plan

<!--
Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

### Infrastructure Needed

<!--
(optional)

Use this section if you need things from the project or working group.
Examples include a new subproject, repos requested, GitHub details.
Listing these here allows a working group to get the process for these
resources started right away.
-->

### Upgrade and Migration Strategy

<!--
(optional)

Use this section to detail whether this feature needs an upgrade or
migration strategy. This is especially useful when we modify a
behavior or add a feature that may replace and deprecate a current one.
-->

### Implementation Pull Requests

<!--
Once the TEP is ready to be marked as implemented, list down all the GitHub
merged pull requests.

Note: This section is exclusively for merged pull requests for this TEP.
It will be a quick reference for those looking for implementation of this TEP.
-->

## References

<!--
(optional)

Use this section to add links to GitHub issues, other TEPs, design docs in Tekton
shared drive, examples, etc. This is useful to refer back to any other related links
to get more details.
